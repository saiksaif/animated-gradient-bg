# Random Gradient Animation

A one-page HTML and CSS project that generates random gradient designs on a black background. This project is ideal for adding a visually appealing and dynamic element to your web page backgrounds or sections.

## Description

This project consists of a single HTML file and a CSS file. When the HTML file is opened in a web browser, it displays a black background with animated random gradient designs. These gradients are generated dynamically using CSS animations, creating an eye-catching visual effect.

## Usage

You can use this project to enhance the visual appeal of your web pages. Here are some use cases:

- **Website Background:** Apply the animation to the background of your entire website or specific sections to create an engaging first impression.

- **Header or Hero Section:** Add the animation to your website's header or hero section to draw attention to important content.

- **Call to Action:** Use it as a background for call-to-action (CTA) elements to make them stand out.

- **Portfolio or Showcase:** Display your work or products on a page with this animated background to captivate your audience.

- **Presentation:** Utilize it as a background for presentations or slideshows to make your content more visually appealing.

- **Loading Screen:** Use it as a loading screen for your web application or website to entertain users while content loads.

## Compatibility

This project is compatible with modern web browsers and is easy to integrate into existing web projects. It requires no external libraries or dependencies.

## Customization

While the project provides a random gradient animation by default, you can customize it to fit your design preferences. Modify the CSS file to change aspects such as animation speed, gradient colors, shapes, or patterns.

## Get Started

To use this project, simply include the HTML and CSS files in your web project directory and reference the HTML file from your web pages.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <title>Random Gradient Animation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="gradient1"></div>

      <div class="innercontainer">
        <div class="gradient3"></div>
        <div class="gradient4"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="gradient2"></div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <!-- Your content goes here -->
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Dont forget to adjust it's z-index properly so that it doesn't get on top of your content. Also, I didn't make it responsive, it will look good in just desktop, create a non-animated gradient backgruond for mobile instead.


You may use it whereever you want however I donot give consent to anyone to claim it as their own work. :)
